    "**Why SSD**?\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) is a fast and accurate object detection algorithm that uses a single deep neural network to predict object classes and locations. It was developed by researchers at Google and published in a 2015 paper titled \"SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of SSD is that it is relatively fast compared to other object detection algorithms, as it uses a **single feedforward convolutional neural network (CNN)** to make predictions. This allows it to run in real-time on most devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of SSD is that it is relatively simple to implement and train, as it does not require the use of region proposal algorithms or anchor boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage of SSD is that it may not be as accurate as other object detection algorithms, such as Faster R-CNN, which uses a two-stage approach to object detection. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, recent improvements to the SSD architecture, such as the addition of the ```ResNet101``` feature extractor, have significantly improved the accuracy of SSD."

    "#### Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "```num_epochs``` = one forward pass and one backward pass of all the training examples. One step takes on average 2 seconds, an epoch consists of 28000 steps (batch_size=1), so the total duration of an epoch is approx 15 hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "A number of epochs of ```1``` means that the model will only make one pass through the entire training dataset. Since we'd like to quickly test the performance of the model on a small training data. However, for most real-world datasets, it is generally not sufficient to train a model to good performance, as the model will not have the opportunity to learn from the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```batch_size``` = the number of training examples in one forward/backward pass (1 step). The higher the batch_size, the more memory space we would need. Here the available memory allows a max of batch_size = 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "A batch size of ```1``` means that the model will process and update its weights based on a single example at a time. This can be useful in our case where we are trying to train on a very small dataset, as it allows the model to make more frequent weight updates. However, it can also be inefficient and slow, as the model must process and update the weights for each example individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "```num_steps```: number of iterations, or a single update of the model weights \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of steps is equal to the number of examples in the dataset (4000) divided by the batch size (1), so it is reasonable to set the number of steps to ```28000``` in this case. However, it is worth noting that the number of steps should generally be determined based on the number of epochs and the batch size, rather than the total number of examples in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```fixed_shape_resizer```: a fixed resolution of ```640x640 px``` is useful for ensuring that all input images have the same size, which can make them easier to process and may improve the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```grid_anchor_generator```: anchor boxes are used to identify potential object locations within the image. The performance of a Faster R-CNN model can be affected by the parameters of the grid anchor generator such as ```scales```, ```aspect_ratios```, ```height_stride```, ```width_stride```, and it may be necessary to experiment with different values to find the best performing configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Overall, these hyperparameters may be suitable for quickly testing the performance of a model on our dataset, but they may not be optimal for training a model to good performance on a real-world dataset."
